# Memory Layout Analysis

## Data Segment Organization

**Analysis Note:** This analysis is based on the MIPS assembly code structure and MARS simulator behavior. Specific memory addresses and performance metrics are estimates for educational purposes.

### Data Structure Layout
```
MIPS Data Segment (.data section)
Estimated organization based on assembly code:

Game Configuration:     ~64 bytes (constants and settings)
Player Data:           ~32 bytes (position, velocity, size)  
Platform Array:        160 bytes (10 platforms × 16 bytes each)
Game State Variables:   ~40 bytes (counters, flags)
String Literals:       ~30 bytes (messages)

Total Data Segment: ~320 bytes
```

## Detailed Memory Allocation

### Game Configuration Block (0x10010000)
```assembly
# Offset | Size | Variable | Purpose
0x00     | 4    | width                    | Screen width (300)
0x04     | 4    | height                   | Screen height (600)
0x08     | 4    | max_level               | Win condition (20)
0x0C     | 4    | platform_y_speed_update | Speed increment (5)
0x10     | 4    | gravity                 | Physics constant (2)
0x14     | 4    | life_value             | Current health (0-10)
0x18     | 4    | max_life_value         | Maximum health (10)
0x1C     | 4    | increase_life_value    | Health gain (+1)
0x20     | 4    | decrease_life_value    | Health loss (-2)
# ... additional config variables
```

**Access Characteristics:**
- **Read-mostly data:** Configuration loaded at initialization  
- **Data Locality:** Related variables grouped together in assembly declarations

### Player Data Block (0x10010040)
```assembly
# Offset | Size | Variable | Purpose | Access Frequency
0x40     | 4    | player_id                    | Entity ID | Low
0x44     | 8    | player_size[2]              | [width, height] | Medium
0x4C     | 8    | player_locs[2]              | [x, y] position | High
0x54     | 8    | player_speed[2]             | [vx, vy] velocity | High
0x5C     | 4    | player_move_on_platform_speed | Base speed | Medium
0x60     | 4    | player_falling_x_speed      | Falling speed | Medium
```

**Programming Characteristics:**
- **Hot Variables:** `player_locs` and `player_speed` accessed frequently per frame
- **Memory Layout:** Contiguous declaration in assembly for better locality
- **Access Pattern:** Sequential reads during physics updates

### Platform Array Block (0x10010080)
```assembly
# Platform Array: 10 platforms × 4 words each = 160 bytes
# Each platform structure (16 bytes):
# [platform_id][x_location][y_location][type]

Platform 0: 0x10010080 - 0x1001008F
Platform 1: 0x10010090 - 0x1001009F
Platform 2: 0x100100A0 - 0x100100AF
...
Platform 9: 0x10010110 - 0x1001011F
```

**Array Access Optimization:**
```assembly
# Efficient platform iteration
la $t0, platforms        # Base address
addi $t1, $zero, 10     # Platform count
addi $t2, $zero, 16     # Stride (4 words × 4 bytes)

platform_loop:
    lw $t3, 0($t0)      # Load platform_id
    lw $t4, 4($t0)      # Load x_location  
    lw $t5, 8($t0)      # Load y_location
    lw $t6, 12($t0)     # Load type
    # Process platform...
    add $t0, $t0, $t2   # Next platform
    addi $t1, $t1, -1   # Decrement counter
    bne $t1, $zero, platform_loop
```

**Array Design Characteristics:**
- **Structure Size:** 16 bytes per platform (4 words)
- **Access Pattern:** Sequential iteration through active platforms
- **Memory Efficiency:** Fixed-size allocation, no dynamic memory

## Stack Usage Analysis

### Function Call Stack Layout
```
Stack Growth Direction: Downward (decreasing addresses)
MARS Default Stack Behavior:

Typical Stack Frame:
+------------------+ <- $sp (current)
| Return Address   | 4 bytes ($ra)
+------------------+
| Saved Registers  | Variable (as needed)
+------------------+  
| Local Variables  | Minimal (mostly register-based)
+------------------+
| Function Args    | Via registers ($a0-$a3)
+------------------+ <- Previous $sp
```

### Stack Depth Analysis
**Maximum Call Stack:**
```
main → init_game → create_player → (3 levels)
main → m_loop → update_player → check_boundary → (4 levels)
main → m_loop → update_platforms → unstable_platform_break → (4 levels)
```

**Stack Usage Characteristics:**
- **Leaf Functions:** Minimal stack usage (save $ra only)
- **Complex Functions:** Additional register saves as needed
- **Maximum Depth:** Shallow call stack (typically 3-4 levels)

## Memory Access Pattern Analysis

### Design Principles Applied

#### Hot Data Organization
```
Frequently accessed data (per frame):
player_locs[2]:     8 bytes  (position coordinates)
player_speed[2]:    8 bytes  (velocity values)  
platform_array:    160 bytes (active platform data)
game_state:        ~16 bytes (counters, flags)
Total Hot Data:    ~192 bytes
```

#### Cold Data Organization  
```
Infrequently accessed data:
Configuration:      ~64 bytes  (game constants)
String Literals:    ~32 bytes  (messages)
Constants:         ~32 bytes  (fixed values)
Total Cold Data:   ~128 bytes
```

## Memory Access Patterns

### Sequential Access (Optimal)
```assembly
# Platform array traversal
la $t0, platforms           # Base address
platform_loop:
    lw $t1, 0($t0)         # Sequential load
    lw $t2, 4($t0)         # Sequential load
    lw $t3, 8($t0)         # Sequential load
    lw $t4, 12($t0)        # Sequential load
    addi $t0, $t0, 16      # Next platform
    bne $t1, $zero, platform_loop
```
**Benefits:** Sequential access promotes cache efficiency and predictable performance

### Random Access (Suboptimal)
```assembly
# Scattered memory access (avoided in hot paths)
lw $t0, player_x           # Cache line A
lw $t1, platform_count     # Cache line B  
lw $t2, game_level        # Cache line C
lw $t3, life_value        # Cache line D
```
**Issues:** Scattered access reduces cache efficiency and predictability

## Memory Optimization Techniques

### 1. Data Structure Packing
```assembly
# Efficient: Related data grouped together
player_data:
    .word 140, 500         # x, y position (8 bytes)
    .word 0, 0            # vx, vy velocity (8 bytes)
    .word 20, 30          # width, height (8 bytes)
    # Total: 24 bytes (single cache line)

# Inefficient: Scattered related data
player_x:     .word 140   # Cache line 1
game_config:  .word 300   # Cache line 2
player_y:     .word 500   # Cache line 1
more_config:  .word 600   # Cache line 2
player_vx:    .word 0     # Cache line 1
```

### 2. Alignment Optimization
```assembly
# All data aligned to 4-byte boundaries
.align 2                   # Ensure word alignment
platform_array: .word 0:40 # 160 bytes, word-aligned
.align 2
player_data: .word 0:8     # 32 bytes, word-aligned
```

### 3. Access Pattern Optimization
```assembly
# Temporal locality: Reuse recently accessed data
lw $t0, player_x($s0)      # Load once
addi $t1, $t0, 5          # Use multiple times
sw $t1, player_x($s0)      # Store back

# Spatial locality: Access nearby data together
lw $t0, 0($s0)            # Load position.x
lw $t1, 4($s0)            # Load position.y (adjacent)
lw $t2, 8($s0)            # Load velocity.x (adjacent)
lw $t3, 12($s0)           # Load velocity.y (adjacent)
```

- **Memory-conscious programming:** Understanding of data layout principles
- **Performance awareness:** Recognition of access pattern importance
